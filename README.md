#UP Robotics 2019-2020 Autonomy Development Simulator
This is a simulator to develop a moon rover's autonomy systems without having an actual robot built yet. Yay!

##Prerequisites
You'll need to have processing installed, available at https://processing.org/download/. Once you have that, go to tools > Install "processing-java". You will also need python3.

###Installing
Run the following
```
git clone https://github.com/maloney20/UPRoboticsADS.git
```

###Running
I've written a basic start script to interface with the simulator via a python script. The commands are "go", "stop", "turn_r", "turn_l". Commands are not case sensitive.
